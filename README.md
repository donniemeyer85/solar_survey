This repository is for the purpose of storing code and other files for the solar panel survey data  project. 

The data is from the NPEL and is a combination of three data sets. You can find more detail about the data in the full_write_up file in this repository.

You can find a quick overview of the project in the presentation slides project.

There are code files for the analysis and markdown portions of the project.
